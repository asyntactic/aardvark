It utilizes declarative documentation about problem domains, data sets, and about the capabilities of data transformation/compute engines. Metadata goes in, and generated transformation code comes out. Aardvark is a \"design-time\" solution, and is agnostic about \"run-time\" compute solutions, with a framework that will support ETL solutions, Big Data technologies such as Pig, Spark, and Hive, and SQL and NoSQL engines.\r\n\r\nMailing lists:\r\n* Users: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/aardvark-data-users\r\n* Developers: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/aardvark-data-dev\r\n",
